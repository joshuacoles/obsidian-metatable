# Inline metatable

The inline metatable is a widget that gets displayed whilst viewing a markdown document in _reading mode_.

Notice that when the mode is _editing_, the frontmatter is displayed as raw YAML.

You might find convenient to open the [[sidebar_metatable]] whilst editing the frontmatter section.
