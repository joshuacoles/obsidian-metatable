# Getting started

This plugin offers two ways of displaying the metadata for a given markdown document: the [[inline_metatable]] or the [[sidebar_metatable]].

Note that this version does not display the metatable in _editing mode_. It's a known limitation but contributions are welcome!

After [[installation|installing the plugin]], the plugin will be ready to use straight away however it is best to have a quick tour to the [[configuration]] to tweak how the plugin displays the information.

For example, if you tend to have large frontmatter structures you might want to consider [[configuration#Expansion level|tweaking the expansion level]]. I personally use a combination of having the [[sidebar_metatable]] open and collapsing just the root such that when I use the _reading mode_ I don't see the metatable again.

This plugin has only been tested with the default theme so if you are like me and use a different one you might want to [[customising_colours_and_symbols|tweak a few colours]] or even going further and [[customising_parts|adjusting spacing, symbols, etc]].

Thanks for using the plugin and let me know if there is any unexpected behaviour!
