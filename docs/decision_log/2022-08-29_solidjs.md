# Use Solid.js for the UI

[Solid.js] is a library for building reactive user interfaces in TypeScript and
JSX without the need for a virtual DOM layer.

## Proposal

Use [Solid.js] instead of plain DOM to improve the readability and
maintainability of the plugin whilst maintaining a low footprint at runtime.

## Outcome

The migration has been seamless bringing clarity in terms of UI
responsibilities.

From a performance point of view no tests have shown anything to be concerned
about which aligns with the expected minimal footprint advertised by the
library.


## Conclusion

Using [Solid.js] dramatically increases readability as well as state management
reasoning at a very low cost.
