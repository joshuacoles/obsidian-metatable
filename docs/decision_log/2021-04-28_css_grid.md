# Use CSS Grid

The `table` layout is famous for being rigid and full of quirks making
difficult to adjust properly. The struggle increases when you use nested
tables.


## Proposal

Use [CSS Grid] to render a `table` as a table. The Grid layout gives full
control over the 2D plane, let's you control direction, alignment, etc without
getting into the quirks of padding, margin and other tools more adequate for
text-flow control.


## Outcome

[CSS Grid] works perfectly with `table` giving the experience you would've
wanted from the start.


## Conclusion

The change is accepted.
