# Add a sidebar view

Since the introduction of Live Preview, the plugin has lost usefulness given
that most of the time is spent in Editing Mode and very rarely in Reading Mode.

## Proposal

Add a Metatable view that renders on the right hand sidebar.

## Outcome

Adding a new view given how the plugin works is low effort. Some of the
original behaviour might feel unnecessary though, for example the ability to
collapse/expand.


## Conclusion

Having the sidebar, a ribbon icon and a command bring enough value that makes
the Reading Mode irrelevant.
